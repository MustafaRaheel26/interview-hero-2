# 🎯 Interview Hero – Interior Landing Page

Welcome to **Interview Hero 2**, a responsive and animated landing page built with **React** and **custom CSS**.  
This project is a pixel-perfect replication of a premium interior design UI section, focusing on elegance, readability, and performance.

## 🖼️ What’s Inside?

- 📐 **Perfectly Balanced Layout**: A full-screen two-column design — image on the left, text on the right.
- ✨ **Smooth Animations**: Subtle fade-ins, slide-ins, hover effects, and transitions to bring the interface to life.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Adapts gracefully to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- 🎨 **Custom Typography**: Uses the `Avenir` font for a clean and modern look.
- 🔍 **Attention to Detail**: Every font size, line height, margin, and opacity is carefully tuned.
